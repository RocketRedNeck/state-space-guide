# Practical Guide to State-space Control
## Graduate-level control theory for high schoolers

I originally wrote this as a final project for an undergraduate technical
writing class I took at University of California, Santa Cruz in Spring 2017
([CMPE 185](https://cmpe185-spring17-01.courses.soe.ucsc.edu/)). It is intended
as a digest of graduate-level control theory aimed at veteran FIRST Robotics
Competition (FRC) students who know algebra and a bit of physics and are
comfortable with the concept of a PID controller. As I learned the subject of
control theory, I found that it wasn't particularly difficult, but very few
resources exist outside of academia for learning it. This book is intended to
rectify that situation by providing a lower the barrier to entry to the field.

This book reads a lot like a reference manual on control theory and related
tools. It teaches the reader how to start designing and implementing control
systems for practical systems with an emphasis on pragmatism rather than theory.
While the theory is mathematically elegant at times and helps inform what is
going on, one shouldn't lose sight of how it behaves when applied to real
systems.

## Download

A PDF version is available at
https://file.tavsys.net/control/state-space-guide.pdf.

## Running the examples

Examples can be obtained from frccontrol's Git repository at
https://github.com/calcmogul/frccontrol/tree/master/examples. They require
Python 3.5+ and frccontrol. frccontrol can be installed with the following
command.

```
pip3 install --user frccontrol
```

Examples can be run like follows:

```
./examples/elevator.py
```

## Dependencies

To compile the book, the following are required.

* make (to run the makefile)
* texlive-core (for latexmk)
* texlive-latexextra (for bibtex and makeglossaries)
* texlive-bibtexextra (for additional BibTeX styles and bibliography databases)
* xelatex (for setting and using custom fonts)
* biber (for generating bibliography)
* Python 3.5+
  * Python Control (to generate plots and state-space results)
  * frccontrol (to provide FRC wrappers for Python Control)
  * yapf (to format Python source code)
* tk (required on some Linux platforms as a backend for matplotlib)
* Inkscape (to convert SVGs to PDF)
* ghostscript (to reduce size of final PDF for publishing)

### Installing Python Control

Python Control can be installed via pip3. To make pole-zero maps for all the
examples work, build and install the `statesp-zero` branch of Python Control
from the Git repo at https://github.com/calcmogul/python-control instead of
using the version on pypi.org.

```
git clone git://github.com/calcmogul/python-control
cd python-control
git checkout statesp-zero
pip3 install --user .
```

After that, install frccontrol via pip3.

```
pip3 install --user frccontrol
```

## Compiling the book

After installing the dependencies, just run `make`. By default, two files will
be generated: state-space-guide.pdf, which has uncompressed images (way higher
than 300dpi); and state-space-guide-ebook.pdf, which is suitable for online
distribution.

The following make targets are supported for compiling the book with various
levels of image compression.

|Command          |File                            |Purpose                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
|`make book-stamp`|`state-space-guide.pdf`         |Quick content development|
|`make ebook`     |`state-space-guide-ebook.pdf`   |Online distribution      |
|`make printer`   |`state-space-guide-printer.pdf` |Standard color printing  |
|`make prepress`  |`state-space-guide-prepress.pdf`|Book publishing          |

## Future improvements

### Teach topics more thoroughly

The book is still somewhat dense and fast-paced (it covers three classes of
feedback control, two of which are for graduate students, in one short book).
More examples of concepts should help slow the pace down. I should read through
this book as if I was explaining it to my veteran software students and
anticipate gaps in their understanding.

### Finish incomplete topics

The following state-space implementation examples are in progress:

* Elevator
  * Add u_error state to model
  * Include writing unit tests in Google Test
* Flywheel
  * See elevator items
* Drivetrain
  * See elevator items
  * 971/y2017/control_loops/python/polydrivetrain.py?
  * Implement motion profiles to improve state tracking
* Single-jointed arm
  * See elevator items
  * Implement motion profiles to improve state tracking

The following state-space implementation examples are planned:

* Rotating claw with independent top/bottom
  * See 971/y2014/control_loops/python/claw.py
  * Use as example of coordinate transformations for states?

### Supplementary background

Any other results that are good for background but are unnecessary should be
included in an appendix.

Add an appendix on Ito calculus to explain where the Wiener process comes from?

Add a section on polytopes for convex optimization? So far, I've seen it used
for handling saturated control inputs to prioritize tracking some states over
others using the limited control input.
